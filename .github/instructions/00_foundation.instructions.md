FOUNDATION (always follow):

1) Treat these files as canonical sources of truth and align all work with them:
- CLAUDE.md
- design/index.md
- design/high_level_architecture.md
- design/references/reading_list.md

2) If you propose a change that would contradict high_level_architecture.md,
   update high_level_architecture.md first (as the contract), then cascade changes.

3) When you start a new task, first scan those files (or ask to attach them if missing).
